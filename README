# SXList

Just a simple library made from scratch to have dynamic-sized lists like the ones in high-level lanaguages.

I might use it in my projects (or may not).

it's just one of the projects that I will be making to learn C by myself.

## Contributions

no one will see this but contributions are not permitted, any changes should only be made by me so that I could improve. Feel free to write issues for things i could improve (no code permitted just the abstract idea)

###### dont judge! I did my best okay?
